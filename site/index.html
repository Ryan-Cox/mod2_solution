	<p>“The McLaren 650S is a sports car designed and manufactured by McLaren Automotive. It was announced in February 2014 as a new model, but based on the existing McLaren MP4-12C with 25 percent new parts, and was formally unveiled at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show.
	<br/>
	The 650S shares the MP4-12C's Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer chassis, and is powered by the same McLaren M838T 3.8-litre V8, twin-turbo engine, but now developing 641 bhp (478 kW; 650 PS) and 500 lb·ft (680 N·m) of torque. Power is transmitted to the wheels through a seven-speed near instantaneous shift dual-clutch gearbox.
	<br/>
	The 650S has a claimed top speed of 333 km/h (207 mph), and can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.8 seconds and from 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 8.6 seconds.” -Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_650S)</p>

	<p>“The McLaren MP4-12C, later known simply as the McLaren 12C, is a sports car designed and manufactured by McLaren Automotive. It is the first production car wholly designed and built by McLaren since the McLaren F1, which ended production in 1998. The car's final design was unveiled in September 2009, and was launched in mid-2011.
	<br/>
	The MP4-12C features a carbon fibre composite chassis, and is powered by a mid-mounted McLaren M838T 3.8-litre V8, twin-turbo engine developing approximately 592 hp (441 kW; 600 PS) and around 443 lb·ft (601 N·m) of torque. The car makes use of Formula 1-sourced technologies such as "brake steer",where the inside rear wheel is braked during fast cornering to reduce understeer. Power is transmitted to the wheels through a seven-speed seamless shift dual-clutch gearbox.
	<br/>
	A convertible version of the car called the MP4-12C Spider, renamed the 12C Spider in 2012, is also available. In February 2014, McLaren announced the related 650S, with revised bodywork, upgraded engine and other technical improvements. In April 2014, McLaren announced the end of production of the 12C.” -Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_12C)</p>

	<p>“McLaren’s hot, new 675LT is a higher-performance variant of the 650S, and the LT portion of its name is derived from the wild 1997 F1 GT "Longtail" homologation special. That rare McLaren menaced the road with radically lengthened bodywork, racy aerodynamics, and a better power-to-weight ratio than the car on which it was based. The 675LT has two of those things, but its tail? Quite vestigial, we’d say.
	<br/>
	In fact, the 675LT is just 1.5 inches longer than the 650S, and it appears a decent stretch of that extra length comes from the sports car’s epic chin splitter. The rest goes to a slightly longer active rear spoiler that McLaren claims is 50 percent larger than the one fitted to the 650S. McLaren says that a “focus on outright performance, weight reduction, and ultimate levels of driver engagement” define a Longtail, so maybe we’re just being too literal. That said, the mighty F1 GT Longtail got more tail—the car was a full 25 inches longer than the regular F1—not to mention a full aero kit that entirely altered the supercar’s visuals.” - Car and Driver (http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2016-mclaren-675lt-photos-and-info-news)</p>
